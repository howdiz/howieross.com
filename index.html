      <h1>I’m Howie Ross and I do several things;</h1>
      <p>I’m Development Director at <a href="http://o3world.com/">O3 World</a>, A digital product design and
        development agency. I’m also an Adjunct Professor in the UX/IxD Masters
        program at Philadelphia U. I guest lecture and speak at NYCDA , Epicodus
        conference and meetups. I organize
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CTO-School-Philadelphia/">CTO School
          Philly</a>, a meet up for local
        tech leaders. I’m on the board of the <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/philadelphia" />
        Philly Awesome Foundation </a> and a
        member of the South Kensington Neighborhood Advisory Committee</p>
      <p>For Fun, I mostly like to get outside whether that be on foot running or
        hiking, on bike, board or dangling from a rock face.</p>
      <p>I’m also into beer, which I’ve been brewing for over a decade and I’m a
        recent convert to coffee geekism. </p>
